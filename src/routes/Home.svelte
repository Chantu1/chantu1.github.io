		I am a <strong>web developer</strong> with a passion for turning ideas into functional websites.
		My journey into the world of web development began a year ago and I've been hooked ever since. I
		started coding by diving into online courses, and one that really made a difference was
		<em><strong>The Odin Project</strong></em>. Through this comprehensive program, I gained a solid
		foundation in various web technologies and learned to build projects that showcase my skills.
